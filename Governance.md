1.	Introduction
This proposal sets out a governance model for the Open Education API project (OOAPI). It describes the decision-making process and the roles of the various members of the project, working group and community. It also sets out the basic rules and guidelines (the so-called by-laws) of all processes related to communication, participation and decision-making within the Open Education API project, with the primary purpose of providing transparency to the Open Education API community.

The shared goals of a governance model for this Open Education API project are to provide:
•	Sustainability
Ensure the sustainability and health of the project and the community;

•	Structure
Provide structure in the organisation so that the decision-making process is clear;

•	Transparency
Provide transparency to the community on communication about, participation in and decision-making within the project; 

•	Growth
Provide for a structure that can grow in the shape of new adopters and developers, and that can support the community;

•	Development
Support effective development and maintenance of the Open Education API;


1.1.	Why does the Open Education API need formal governance?
The Open Education API Working Group (OOAPI-WG) has indicated that the point at which the OOAPI has its first major release, a 1.0 status, has now been reached. This is an important point for institutions to be able to implement and use the OOAPI, given that the API has major-release status and is not considered to be an experiment. 
This governance model has been drawn up to give the specification a sustainable character. It provides interested parties with an understanding of how the project will be governed. After all, 'Governance' is the governance instrument that sets the framework and defines how strategic goals, decision structures and procedures to address differences of views operate.



2.	Abbreviations and definitions used

OOAPI
The Open Education API. In Dutch we say: Open Onderwijs API, hence the abbreviation OOAPI. SURFnet is working with higher education institutions to define a standard API: the Open Education API. Using this API, higher education institutions can make useful information available, such as grades, study credits, schedules and free workstations. Application developers can then integrate this data into new applications.
Project group
The OOAPI project group, currently provided by SURFnet. Responsible for funding and annual planning.

Working group
The OOAPI working group. Responsible for development, management, promotion, community, communication, adoption and evaluation of the Open Education API. This working group consists of various institutions, representatives of the OOAPI and SURFnet. 
Bureau Edustandaard
Bureau Edustandaard, a partnership between SURF and Kennisnet, is responsible for managing and advising on education-specific and research-specific standards and reference architectures for the entire education and research chain. 
The project group and the working group are in regular contact with Bureau Edustandaard. Bureau Edustandaard provides advice and support. 
Community
The OOAPI community consists of parties interested in OOAPI developments. Community members are known by name and email address, and register with the community site themselves.

Community site
The website where community members become members of the OOAPI community and share their knowledge. Google+ Communities is used for this. The community site can be found at: https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/106455663981908394819
Project site
The website at https://openonderwijsapi.nl/en/. This website will be used mainly to provide clarification of the project to interested parties. The site also provides access to the reference API, online documentation and the code repository.
Code repository
The GitHub code repository where the specification for the Open Education API can be found.
https://github.com/open-education-api

Specification repository
The OOAPI specification and its various versions are maintained in the GitHub specification repository:
https://github.com/open-education-api/specification

Mailing list
The members of the working group are subscribed to the mailing list, which is intended for members of the working group to communicate with each other. 
See: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openonderwijsapi


3.	Project participants
There are a number of participants in the OOAPI project: the community, the working group, the project group and Bureau Edustandaard. The diagram below shows their mutual relationships.

3.1.	Open Education API community
The community is formed by individuals, (representatives of) higher education institutions and organisations interested in the OOAPI project. Community members are known by name and email address, and register with the OOAPI community site themselves.

Anyone who uses the OOAPI but is not known by name is an anonymous community member. We do not consider them part of the community.  To a greater or lesser extent, community members participate actively in this project. They ask questions, propose potential modifications to the specification, provide feedback and ensure an active community site. 
3.2.	Open Education API working group
The working group is a subgroup of the community. This working group is, in essence, central to the OOAPI project and is responsible for the roadmap, further development and overall decision-making within the development of the project. The working group is responsible for the specification in terms of development, management, promotion, community, adoption and evaluation.
The working group currently consists of the following members.

Who can join the working group?
-	Participation is not limited to higher education institutions, and is open to anyone who can represent the interests of the OOAPI. Suppliers can therefore also join the working group.
-	The ratio between institutions affiliated with SURFnet and organisations not affiliated with SURFnet must be at least 3:1. List of affiliated institutions. 
-	A member of the working group may represent up to one higher education institution or organisation.
-	The working group may have more than one member from the same institution, but if there are more than 20 members in the working group, the maximum number of members per institution is limited to one. If a member of the working group is unable to attend a meeting, an alternate member may be appointed.
-	SURFnet's project staff are members of the working group. Their status is protected and their membership does not count towards the total number of members. 

Becoming a member of the working group 
-	Prospective members can enlist by posting a motivation message on the community site or sending an email to info@openonderwijsapi.nl, with a brief motivation.
-	A prospective member may also be nominated by a member of the working group. 
-	The working group votes on membership of organisation not affiliated with SURFnet. 
-	Any new member of the working group must have an authorised signatory of the institution or organisation they work for to sign a letter of intent in which they agree to the rights and obligations of the working group member. 

Terminating membership of the working group
-	A working group member can terminate their membership through the mailing list.
-	The working group may terminate the membership of a member who fails to meet their obligations.
-	Former working group members can be kept informed of developments, if desired, but lose their voting rights.

Rights and obligations 
The working group member
•	represents their employer, an organisation that promotes the interests of the Open Education API. This organisation has the intention to implement the OOAPI within 2 years;
•	actively contributes to developing the Open Education API and promotes its use. He or she must invest at least 60 hours a year to achieve the working group's objectives;
•	must visit at least 3 working group meetings a year.
Only institutions affiliated with SURFnet and 1 representative for each institution affiliated with SURFnet have voting rights. 
3.3.	Open Education API project group 
The project group consists of SURFnet staff members. Project staff are actively involved with the OOAPI working group as members of the working group. Project staff have a mandate for implementing the project objectives with the associated resources, as set out in an annual activity plan. Governance is provided by the Education Innovation with IT project manager, through the SURFnet project organisation. 
3.4.	Bureau Edustandaard
Bureau Edustandaard, a partnership between SURF and Kennisnet, is responsible for managing and advising on education-specific and research-specific standards and reference architectures for the entire education and research chain. Edustandaard is transparent about the standards it manages. The bureau facilitates the Standardisation council, the Architecture council and the Edustandaard working groups. The bureau also maintains contact with other (national and international) standards organisations.
The project group and the working group are in regular contact with Bureau Edustandaard. Bureau Edustandaard provides advice and support. 




4.	The Open Education API 'by-laws'

4.1.	Communication guidelines
Our aim is to communicate as openly as possible, so open platforms are used for this. At the same time, there will also be a need for consultation exclusively within the working group, so there are multiple communication channels. Each channel has its own target group and purpose. 
The language of communication is Dutch. The language of the specification and discussions on the specification on GitHub is English.

1.	Open Education API website
The OOAPI site at https://openonderwijsapi.nl/en/ will be used mainly to provide clarification to interested parties. The site also provides references to the reference API, online documentation and the code repository. Communication will primarily be one-way, from the OOAPI project to the interested parties. It will not be possible to directly post or publish to the website through the community. The site indicates that the email address info@openonderwijsapi.nl or the community site can be used to provide feedback if desired.

2.	The general email address info@openonderwijsapi.nl
This address is used as the general email address for the OOAPI project. Email to this address will be delivered to SURFnet's project staff. This email address can be used by prospective group members to sign up as a member of the working group.

3.	Mailing list  
This list serves as a discussion list for the OOAPI and is hosted by Google Groups. The list is not public and only list subscribers can post on the list or read the list archives. Parties interested in the specification and working group members are invited and added to this list by SURFnet's project staff. Each post is sent to all list subscribers and is stored in a private online archive. The list is not included in the Google list directory. The list manager is the openonderwijsapi@gmail.com account, whose credentials are known to SURFnet's project staff.

4.	Community site at https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/106455663981908394819
Google Plus Communities is used for the community platform. This is a public community site where all information can be found without having to sign in. However, if you want to submit a post or a comment, you must be a member of this community. This can be done by signing in with your Google+ account and sending a membership request. The site administrator reviews and accepts or rejects membership requests. This community is managed by the openonderwijsapi@gmail.com account, whose credentials are known to SURFnet's project staff.

Both the project group and the working group will use this community site to make announcements, share minutes of meetings, and so on. The community can respond to this, ask questions or add new topics.

5.	Github https://github.com/open-education-api
The specification is hosted on GitHub. Development of the specification, outstanding issues and a timeline for the delivery of a new version of the API are shared through GitHub. Two members of the working group are given the status of 'master committer' and ‘backup master committer’. These members are nominated from among the working group and are appointed by the other members of the working group. They are responsible for adding and deleting code from the GitHub repository. Everyone is free to use the repository and can provide their own code by sending a pull request to the master committers. SURFnet project staff will remain the owner of the GitHub repository for the duration of the project.

4.2.	Rules on participation
This section describes how community members can contribute to the project, for instance through discussion, providing feedback, expanding the specification and ongoing development.
•	Contributing to the OOAPI specification; feedback on the OOAPI can be provided by the entire community through the community site. This is not reserved for the working group only. 
•	Community members can expand the OOAPI during implementation by adding an extension. This extension will not yet be part of the specification. Working group members decide whether this extension can be included in the next version of the OOAPI standard. 
•	Contributing to the code on GitHub; anyone can submit pull requests to one of the OOAPI code repositories. The working group decides on acceptance of code contributions.

4.3.	Rules on decision-making
This section describes how decision-making within the project takes place. 
The working group is responsible for the community, communication, development, management and promoting the use of the OOAPI, i.e. the specification itself, the documentation, the reference implementation and the online demo. The working group decides on expansion, adaptation and modification of the OOAPI specification. The working group also decides on adding new members to the working group.
The decision-making procedure is as follows: 
There are two forms of decision-making:
•	Decisions on the specification description on GitHub
•	Decisions on the method and the acceptance of proposed major changes within GitHub, for example, a release.

Decisions within GitHub
For issues within the GitHub environment, the following applies: If an issue is submitted, the master committer has 5 days to prepare for handling the issue. The voting procedure is started within these 5 days so that the decision can be voted on.
The decision in respect of which an issue is handled is recorded within the GitHub environment. See the info at https://openonderwijsapi.nl/en/community/

Other decisions
Remote voting can take place online at any time through email using the mailinglist openonderwijsapi@googlegroups.com or can be send by email. Any working group member can submit a decision to be voted on. 
All working group members receive an email of the forthcoming vote. This notification specifies: 
•	the matter which is the subject of the vote; 
•	when the vote will take place;
•	and, if necessary, the timeframe within which a vote must be cast.
There must be a period of at least 7 days between the announcement of the vote and the time a vote can be cast. Only members of the working group can cast a vote.
Voting can take place online OR at a meeting. If a member cannot attend the meeting, they must make their vote known before the meeting by sending an email to openonderwijsapi@googlegroups.com. Votes cast after the meeting will not be taken into consideration in taking the decision.
If there is a majority vote, the decision will be adopted.
If there is no majority vote, or if a vote leads to discussion or a member of the working group appeals against the decision, the vote will be put as an agenda item for the next meeting of the working group. A working group member can appeal against a decision by formulating their objection and sharing it through the mailing list.  
The following rules apply to decision-making:
•	Only institutions affiliated with SURFnet and 1 representative per institution have voting rights.
•	SURFnet is also represented in the working group and has 1 vote.
The decision taken is recorded in the decisions list in the minutes or, if it concerns an online decision, is communicated via e-mail.

4.4.	Compliancy rules: when are you in compliance with the specification? 
This section describes how an institution or supplier can demonstrate that they are in compliance with the specification. 
Compliance with the specification is understood to mean:
•	All required fields for the end points have been filled in according to the data requirements. The specific version of the OOAPI being implemented must be specified;
•	Where optional fields are applied, they must be filled in according to the data requirements;
•	Documentation on own implementation is available online for at least the working group members.
Compliance with the specification can be demonstrated with a badge stating 'complies with OOAPI'. Each version of the OOAPI will have its own 'complies with OOAPI Vx.x' badge so that it is clear which version of the specification it complies with.
